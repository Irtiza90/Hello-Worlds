## Contribute
Make a pull request with hello world program in a language we don't have!

- Make sure we don't have the language you want to add.
- Under `programs` directory, add a file with a name like `LanguageName.extension` with hello world code.

## Aim
Original aim was to collect hello world programs *as much as possible*. but after realizing that it's not a very practical plan, temporary goal is to collect more than 60 of them.
